<p><strong>Infections:</strong> AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ may make patients more likely to develop an infection, such as pneumonia, or a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. Viral infections may include reactivation of hepatitis B in people who have had hepatitis B in the past. In some people, these infections may be severe and can even lead to death. Patients may need to be treated as soon as possible. Patients should tell their health care provider right away if they have a temperature of 100.5°F&nbsp;or above, have chills, or do not feel well. Symptoms of hepatitis B or infection may include the following: fever, chills, skin rash, joint pain and inflammation, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, pale stools or dark urine, yellowing of the skin, or pain in the upper right side of the stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Severe Allergic Reactions:</strong> Severe allergic reactions can happen in people who take AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ. Call your health care provider or get medical help right away if you get signs and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction including rash, itching, hives, flushing, trouble breathing or swallowing, chest pain, or dizziness.</p>
<p><strong>Angioedema:</strong> Patients who take an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medicine during treatment with AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ are at a possible increased risk for&nbsp;a type of allergic reaction called angioedema.

Your health care provider should tell you when you may start taking AFINITOR and AFINITOR DISPERZ again after surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Blood Sugar and Fat (cholesterol and triglyceride) Levels in Blood:</strong> Your health care provider should do blood tests to check your fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in the blood before you start and during treatment with AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ.</p>
<p><strong>Decreased Blood Cell Counts:</strong> AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ can cause you to have decreased red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
