<div class="content"> <p>Patients should not take AFINITOR<sup>®</sup> (everolimus) Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ<sup>®</sup> (everolimus tablets for oral suspension) if they are allergic to AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ or to any of its ingredients. Patients should tell their health care provider before taking AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ if they are allergic to sirolimus (Rapamune<sup>®</sup>) or temsirolimus (Torisel<sup>®</sup>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ can cause serious side effects that can even lead to death. If patients experience these side effects, they may need to stop taking AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ for a while or use a lower dose. Patients should follow their health care provider’s instructions. Please be aware of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You may develop lung or breathing problems.</strong> In some people, lung or breathing problems may be severe and can even lead to death. Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or wheezing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You may be more likely to develop an infection,</strong> such as pneumonia, or a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection. Viral infections may include reactivation of hepatitis B in people who have had hepatitis B in the past. In some people (including adults and children), these infections may be severe and can even lead to death. You may need to be treated as soon as possible. You should tell your health care provider right away if you have a temperature of 100.5˚F or above, chills, or do not feel well. Symptoms of hepatitis B or infection may include the following: fever, chills, skin rash, joint pain and inflammation, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, pale stools or dark urine, yellowing of the skin, or pain in the upper right side of the stomach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Call your health care provider or get medical help right away if you get signs and symptoms of a severe allergic reaction including rash, itching, hives, flushing, trouble breathing or swallowing, chest pain, or dizziness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Possible increased risk for a type of allergic reaction called angioedema</strong> in people who take an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medicine during treatment with AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ. Talk with your health care provider before taking AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ if you are not sure if you take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Get medical help right away if you have trouble breathing or develop swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat during treatment with AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ.</p>

<li>Are planning to have surgery or if you have had a recent surgery. You should stop taking AFINITOR or AFINITOR DISPERZ at least 1 week before planned surgery</li>
